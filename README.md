bluetooth_spider
================

This is the arduino code for a cheap, hacked, robot toy that can move in 2 axis and be controlled by bluetooth. More information on how to built it are on my blog here: https://platis.solutions/blog/2014/11/15/diy-bluetooth-enhanced-spider-robot/

The actual code used, is the one in the "Spider" sketch. The rest are some test cases that can prove valuable while building it up and assembling it, in order to make sure that everything works as intended.
